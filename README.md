# FEM-beam-model-dynamic-analysis
2D/3D Finite Element (FEM) beam model using Newmark Method for dynamic analysis

### Aim
This code provides an example of 2D and 3D dynamic linear elastic FEM code using Newmark Method. It contains a beam mesh with force exerted at the designated point and reveals the dynamic responses on the beam. It shows how to solve the global system equations in the FEM models.

### Input file
In order to run the model, it is necessary to have the following variables as input:

__nprops__: No. material parameters
__materialprops(i)__: List of material parameters
